# Install or update HI5 on a TrimUI Brick, Brick Hammer or Brick Pro. Run it on a

#
# It finds the TrimUI over SSH (the firmware's SSH server must be on), compares the installed
# version with the latest GitHub release, and copies the new build to SD:/Apps/HI5 if the release
# is newer. Your song (hi5.sav) and any samples you added stay as they are.
#
#   HI5_HOST=192.168.1.28    skip the scan and use this address
#   HI5_USER=root            SSH user (root by default)
#   HI5_DEVICE=brickpro      the Brick Pro's build (with the sticks); brick for the Brick and Brick
#                           Hammer. An installed copy says which it is, so this is only needed once.
#   HI5_FORCE=1              reinstall even if the TrimUI already has the latest version
#
# The address that worked is saved in ~/.config/hi5-trimui/host and tried first next time.

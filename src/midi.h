/* MIDI over USB, from Jaffedrone: class-compliant drum machines, sequencers
 * and interfaces on the TrimUI's USB-C port (an OTG adapter or a hub), read
 * and written through ALSA's raw MIDI ports (/dev/snd/midiC*D*), so nothing
 * more is needed on the device. Ports are found as they are plugged in.
 *
 * In (any channel):
 *   clock          the tempo follows it, and its phase is held by trimming
 *                  the playback speed, as Wi-Fi sync does
 *   START          from the top;  CONTINUE  from where it stopped;  STOP
 *   song position  places the sequencer (in 16ths)
 * Out, to every port: clock (24 a quarter note), START and STOP, while the
 * sequencer plays and no clock is coming in. The clock goes out as the sound
 * is heard, the audio buffer's time behind the engine.
 *
 * Settings, in launch.sh: HI5_MIDI=0 turns it off, HI5_MIDI_CLOCK=0 sends no
 * clock, HI5_MIDI_FOLLOW=0 ignores the clock coming in. */

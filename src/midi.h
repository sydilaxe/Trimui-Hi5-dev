/* MIDI over USB, from Jaffedrone: class-compliant drum machines, sequencers
 * and interfaces on the TrimUI's USB host port (the Brick's top USB-C), read
 * and written through ALSA's raw MIDI ports (/dev/snd/midiC*D*), so nothing
 * more is needed on the device. Ports are found as they are plugged in.
 *
 * In (any channel):
 *   clock          the tempo follows it, and its phase is held by trimming
 *                  the playback speed, as Wi-Fi sync does
 *   START          from the top;  CONTINUE  from where it stopped;  STOP
 *   song position  places the sequencer (in 16ths)
 *   CC             the important settings (ui_midi_cc; see docs/MIDI.md)
 * Out, to every port: clock (24 a quarter note), START and STOP, while the
 * sequencer plays and no clock is coming in. The clock goes out as the sound
 * is heard, the audio buffer's time behind the engine.
 *
 * Which way the clock goes is the SONG page's MIDI setting (song.midi_mode:
 * AUTO as above, SEND always, FOLLOW only, OFF neither), and START set to
 * IGNORE follows the clock's tempo but not its START, STOP, CONTINUE or song
 * position. Bricks also follow one another over USB through a hub (link.h).
 * In launch.sh: HI5_MIDI=0 turns MIDI off, HI5_MIDI_CLOCK=0 never sends clock,
 * HI5_MIDI_FOLLOW=0 never follows it, whatever the setting. */
